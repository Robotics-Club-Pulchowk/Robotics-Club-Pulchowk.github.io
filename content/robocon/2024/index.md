With the theme “Harvest Day” symbolizing the agricultural history of Vietnam, ABU Robocon 2024 was hosted in Quang Ninh province of Vietnam. The theme consisted of a full agrarian cycle i.e. planting, harvesting and storing. Each participating team needed to make two robots: **Robot 1** and **Robot 2**; out of which Robot 1 should be an automatic robot and Robot 2 could be manual/semi-automatic/automatic. One team would be **Red** and the other team would be **Blue**.

As per the theme, Robot 1 had access to planting and harvesting zones while Robot 2 had access to planting, harvesting, storage and silo zones. At first, our Robot 1 planted the seedlings on top of pre-determined markers. Based on the number of successful planting, grains were harvested by Robot 1 in the following order: **1 Empty Grain (Purple ball)**, then **1 Paddy Rice (Team coloured ball)**.

Finally, our Robot 2 would go to the storage zone, pick up Paddy Rice and then store that rice in one of the **five silos (cylindrical storage vessels)** in the silo zone. The team that captures 3 silos (storage vessels) first wins, else the winner is decided on the basis of points received from planting, harvesting and storing.

Robot 1 had a unique seedling intake design based on a pulley and belt mechanism as well as a screw mechanism for seedling storage. Robot 2 had a roller mechanism mounted with multiple Mecanum wheels for easy intake of grains. In the event, Team Nepal won the **Tokyo Electron Award** for the unique design of robots.
