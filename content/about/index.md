The Robotics Club at Pulchowk Campus of the Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University was established 2001 A.D., and in the 22 years since, the club has had a very colorful and rich history as the leading robotics club in the country.Among the plethora of activities we participate in throughout the year, we represent our country Nepal at the annual Asia-wide robotics competition ABU Robocon.  Every year, the efforts for building these robots brings together more than 50 people, representing all years, faculties, genders, ethnicities and from all corners of the country. Our crew spends time together designing, prototyping, testing and fabricating robots before, between and after classes.
